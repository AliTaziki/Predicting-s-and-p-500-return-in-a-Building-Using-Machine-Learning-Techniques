# Predicting-s-and-p-500-return-in-a-Building-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this project, I implemented Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN Regression , Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression,   with Python on a data set that contains four Macroenonomic features including inflation,real interest rate ,gdp growth rate and unemplyment rate these data are downloaded from World Bank website. First of all, I explored and then visualized data using some plots. After that, the machine learning project starts. Next, 5 mentioned regression models are implemented.
